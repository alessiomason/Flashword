Ever heard a word you did not know, looked it up, and then quickly forgot about it?
If that is the case, Flashword comes to the rescue!

With Flashword, you can save new words you hear or learn in any way. You can look them up using the system's dictionaries and you can take notes for every word, maybe to jot down a translation, maybe to remember the context you first heard that word in, maybe to highlight interesting use cases.
You can also divide the words into categories of your choosing to quickly organize the words you save!
